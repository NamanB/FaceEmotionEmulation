Hello, and welcome to Face Fetch! The objective of this game is simple: try and match the faces you see to your best ability. Here’s how it works:
•	Take a look at the picture and mimic the facial expressions you see
o	Don’t like the picture you see? You can always press the “next photo” button for a fresh face
•	Once you feel that your face is in the right position, press the “take photo”
o	If your photo doesn’t come out as well as you hoped, you can always press the “retry” button to go again, or even the “next photo” button to try a different face
o	But if you’re satisfied with the results press the “score” button to see how close your photo is to the original. See if you can get 100%!
•	After scoring your photo, you can always press the “next photo” button to keep playing
•	Good luck, and HAVE FUN!
